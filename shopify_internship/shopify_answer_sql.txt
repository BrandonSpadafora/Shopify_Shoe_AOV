SELECT *
FROM shopify_data ;


/* count  of total orders is 15,725,640 */
SELECT SUM(order_amount) AS total_orders
FROM shopify_data; 

/* total items bought is 43,936*/
SELECT SUM(total_items) AS total_items
FROM shopify_data;

/* AOV is 357*/
SELECT SUM(order_amount) / SUM(total_items) AS average_order_value
FROM shopify_data;
